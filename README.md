# ML5 Alchemy Game

## About the Game

ML5 Alchemy Game is an interactive web-based game inspired by the popular Little Alchemy game. Players combine basic elements (fire, water, air, and earth) to create hundreds of new elements through various combinations. The game uses hand tracking technology to allow players to interact with elements using their hands in front of a webcam, creating an immersive and intuitive gameplay experience.

Players start with the four basic elements and can drag them into the play area. When two compatible elements are brought close together, they combine to form a new element. With over 200 possible combinations, there's plenty to discover and experiment with!

## How to Play

1. Allow camera access when prompted
2. Use your thumb and index finger to "pinch" elements at the bottom of the screen
3. Drag elements around the screen by moving your hand
4. Combine elements by bringing them close to each other
5. Discover new elements through various combinations
6. Use the "Clear" button to reset the play area
